## BPDM Gate

The BPDM Gate offers an API for Eclipse Tractus-X members to share their own business partner data with Eclipse Tractus-X. Such members are called sharing
members.
Via the Gate service they can add their own business partner records but also retrieve cleaned and enhanced data back in return over the sharing process.
Shared business partner records that have successfully gone through the sharing process end up in the BPDM Pool and will receive a BPN there (or merge with an
existing record).

The Gate offers an [API](../bpdm-gate-api) to query and share business partners.
