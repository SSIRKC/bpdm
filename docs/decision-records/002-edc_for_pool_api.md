# EDC is not a mandatory, but recommended component for accessing BPDM Pool API/Data

* status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement
Ensuring Data Sovereignty is a very crucial point to be compliant to Catena-X Guidelines and passing the Quality Gates. A key aspect to technical realize Data Sovereignty is the Eclipse Dataspace Component (EDC). The question for this ADR is, clarifying if an EDC is required to access the BPDM Pool API/Data.

## Decision Outcome
In alignment with PCA (Maximilian Ong) and BDA (Christopher Winter) it is not mandatory to have an EDC as a "Gatekeeper" in front of the BPDM Pool API for passing the Quality criteria/gates of Catena-X. Nevertheless it is recommended to use one. Especially when you think long-term about sharing data across other Dataspaces.

### Reason
In case of BPDM Pool provides no confidential data about Business Partners. It's like a "phone book" which has public available data about the Business Partners which are commercially offered, because of the additional data quality and data enhancement features.

### Implications
It must be ensured that only Catena-X Member have access to the BPDM Pool API. In Fact an Identity and Access Management is required in the Pool Backend which checks the technical users based on its associated roles and rights.
